## 🎯 Features

- **Voice/Sound Control**: Control the ball's movement using your microphone
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Advanced Web Audio API implementation with RMS analysis
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic gravity and bouncing mechanics
- **Visual Effects**: Particle-based fireworks system with canvas rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Fallback mechanisms for different browser capabilities

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Web Audio API** - Real-time audio processing
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Graphics and particle effects
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
